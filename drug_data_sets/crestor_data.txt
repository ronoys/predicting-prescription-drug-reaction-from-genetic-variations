The correlation between APoB concentration and LDL cholesterol before and after treatment changed only slightly for the AG+GG genotypes (before rho = 0.55 p <0.001; after rho = 0.50 p<0.001) but decreased significantly for the AA genotype (before rho = 0.78 p<0.001; after rho 0.44 p<0.001) showing that the absolute reduction of ApoB was much smaller than the statin-induced reduction of LDLc.

Similar genotype frequencies were observed across groups except an Indian subset who were TT. Only one Caucasian was CC.
